The SDO spacecraft was not so fortunate: its orbit only allowed it to observe a partial eclipse that at its peak covered only about 14 per cent of the sun (Aug. 21, 2017). Most of the people in the U.S. (weather permitting) observed at least 60 per cent coverage of the sun by the Moon. The good news for SDO is that it gets to see partial and solar eclipses several times a year. So, it all kind of balances out, in a way.

The Toshka Lakes (center) were formed in the Sahara Desert of Egypt by water from the River Nile conveyed from Lake Nasser by a canal to the Toshka Depression. Flooding of the Toshka Depression had created the four main lakes with a maximum surface area in 2002 of approximately 1,450 square kilometers ? around 25.26 billion cubic meters of water. By 2006 the stored water was reduced by 50 per cent and by 2012 shows open water only in the lowest parts of the main western and eastern  basins?representing a reduction in surface area to 307 square kilometers?nearly 80 per cent smaller than the 2002 surface area. Standing water is almost completely absent from the central basin. From space, astronauts documented the first lake?the easternmost one?in 1998. The lakes progressively grew in depressions to the west, the westernmost filling between 2000 and 2001. This image shows lines of center-point agricultural fields near the east-basin lake nearest Lake Nasser. Sunglint on the western lake makes the water surface appear both light and dark, depending on which parts of the surface were ruffled by the wind at the moment the image was taken.",

The Mars Polar Lander is targeted for launch from Cape Canaveral Air Station aboard a Delta II rocket on Jan. 3, 1999. The solar-powered spacecraft is designed to touch down on the Martian surface near the northern-most boundary of the south pole in order to study the water cycle there. The lander also will help scientists learn more about climate change and current resources on Mars, studying such things as frost, dust, water vapor and condensates in the Martian atmosphere",

Everglades National Park in southern Florida is the largest subtropical wilderness in the United States. Known as the "river of grass", the Everglades wetlands and wooded uplands host a variety of endangered species including crocodiles, manatees, and panthers. During the late 19th and 20th centuries, the original 11,000 square miles of wetlands were viewed as useless swampland in need of reclamation. The success of reclamation efforts -- for agriculture and urban expansion in southern Florida -- has led to the loss of approximately 50 per cent of the original wetlands and 90 per cent of wading bird species. Today, an extensive restoration effort is underway to return portions of the Everglades to a more natural state and prevent further ecosystem degradation. This view highlights the southern Everglades estuarine ecosystem where the wetlands meet Florida Bay. Thin fingers of land and small islands (keys) host mangrove, hardwood hammocks, marsh and prairie (mainly dark to light green in the image). The tan and grayish-brown areas are dominantly scrub, marshland and prairie; small green "dots" and narrow lines in this region are isolated mangrove and hardwood stands indicating the general direction of slow water flow toward the bay. The silver-gray regions are water surfaces highlighted by sunglint. The roadway forming the western boundary of the National Park is US Route 1 connecting the Miami metropolitan area to the north (not shown) with the Florida Keys to the south (not shown). A small built feature visible along the roadway is a fishing camp.',

The galaxy is much like our own galaxy, the Milky Way. The disc-shaped galaxy is seen face on, revealing the winding structure of the spiral arms. Dark patches in these spiral arms are in fact dust and gas — the raw materials for new stars. The many young stars that form in these regions make the spiral arms appear bright and bluish. The galaxy sits in a vibrant area of the night sky within the constellation of Dorado (The Swordfish), and appears very close to the Large Magellanic Cloud  — one of the satellite galaxies of the Milky Way. The observations were carried out with the high resolution channel of Hubble’s Advanced Camera for Surveys. This instrument has delivered some of the sharpest views of the Universe so far achieved by mankind. This image covers only a tiny patch of sky — about the size of a one cent euro coin held 100 metres away! A version of this image was entered into the Hubble’s Hidden Treasures image processing competition by flickr user c.claude.",

Condensation trails-or contrails-are straight lines of ice crystals that form in the wake of jet liners where air temperatures are lower than about -40 degrees Centigrade.  Scientists have observed that newer contrails are thin whereas older trails have widened with time as a result of light winds. Because of this tendency for thin contrails to cover greater areas with time, it is estimated that these &#0147;artificial clouds&#0148; cover 0.1 per cent of the planet&#0146;s surface.  Percentages are far higher in some places, say the scientists, such as southern California, the Ohio River Valley and parts of Europe, as illustrated here. The climatic impact of such clouds is poorly understood, which is why scientists continue to study them using images such as this.",

The region shown in the image, known as the Chaudiere-Appalaches, is located midway between Quebec City (the provincial capital) and the international border with the United States (specifically, the State of Maine).  Agriculture is a significant component of Quebec’s industries, with over 50 per cent of the food produced or processed consumed within the province as of 2008 (source: Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada). The tapestry-like pattern is due to the fact that the agricultural fields in the region are closely tied to access roads, with rectangular fields extending outwards perpendicular to the roadways. A similar pattern—embedded within a different social, historical, and economic context—can be seen in the Rondonia region of western Brazil. Snow cover highlights the rectangular fields interspersed with dark green forested patches. The urban area of Saint Georges (left) is visible as a light gray region along the Chaudiere River. The Parc national de Frontenac borders parts of Lac (lake) St.-Francois at upper center, providing an area for outdoor recreation within the intensive agricultural landscape.",

The city of Shanghai sits along the delta banks of the Yangtze River along the eastern coast of China. The city proper is the world’s most populous city (the 2010 census counts 23 million people, including “unregistered” residents). With that many humans, the city is a tremendous sight at night. Shanghai is a key financial capital for China and the Asian Pacific region. The bright lights of the city center and the distinctive new skyscrapers that form the skyline along the Pudong district (the eastern shore of the Huangpu River, a tributary of the Yangtze that cuts through the center of Shanghai) make for spectacular night viewing both on the ground and from space. The official census count in 2000 was 16.4 million; the city population has increased more than 35 per cent since that time. Much of the growth has occurred in new satellite developments like areas to the west of the city (for example, Suzhou). The city’s rapid growth and development during the 20th and 21st centuries have come at a cost. Water availability is a key concern, and groundwater withdrawal has resulted in substantial subsidence in and around the city. Because it is built only a few meters above sea level – on the banks of the deltaic estuary of the Yangtze River – curbing subsidence rates is a critical concern.",

Lake Baikal is a biospheric reserve of high international interest to the global scientific community.  It is home to some 600 endemic species, many found in no other location.  This view shows the northern end of the lake, and was taken in the early morning with low sun highlighting the mountain ranges rimming the lake basin.  Pristine forests surround the lake, although heavy logging is evident in other photography of the central and southern portions of the lake.  Another unique aspect of Lake Baikal is the existence of the world's only known freshwater hydrothermal springs.  The fault system which bounds the lake allows fluids to circulate deep into the Earth and resurface as hot springs around and in the lake.  Russian and American scientists are using the Shuttle photography to examine the relationship of the lake's ice cover to areas of known hydrothermal activity.  Thus Lake Baikal has been and continues to be a high-priority site for photography from space from both the Space Shuttle and the Russian Space Station MIR.",

                                "description": "ISS029-E-037915 (3 Nov. 2011) --- Snowfall on the Selenga River Delta, Russian Federation is featured in this image photographed by an Expedition 29 crew member on the International Space Station. This photograph illustrates the Selenga River Delta built out into Lake Baikal in Russia. The Selenga River delta (center) is lobate in form, with an intricate network of distributary channels and levees surrounded by marshlands building out into Lake Baikal. This suggests that development of the delta is governed by the sediment load carried by the river, and any modifications of form due to lake tides or waves are relatively minor. Further out, dark brown depositional bars are visible forming a rough arc marking the edge of the delta. Snow cover on the river floodplain highlights numerous secondary channels, as well as channels previously occupied by the river but now abandoned. The regular outlines of agricultural fields to the southwest and northeast of the river are also highlighted by the snow cover. Lake Baikal is a World Heritage Site. The Selenga River is the major contributor of water to Lake Baikal; it occupies approximately 82 per cent of the watershed area for the lake. The wetlands of the Selenga River delta are designated as a RAMSAR site and provide valuable habitat for more than 170 species of birds, including many that are migrating. Like Baikal, the Selenga Delta is home to unique ecosystems, including more than 70 rare or endangered species of plants and animals. Waters of the Selenga River serve many (and differing) uses in both Mongolia and Russia, including support of agriculture, provision of drinking water, light industry, mining, recreation, and tourism. These uses also contribute to degradation of the river water quality, downstream availability of water, and ecological impacts. For example, a pulp and paper plant in the city of Selenginsk (lower left) has been tied to high levels of pollution in the river. International efforts to integrate management of the Selenga River basin for both ecological and economic sustainability are ongoing.",

This view depicts the narrow (6 kilometers) strait between Lake Maracaibo to the south and the Gulf of Venezuela to the north. This brackish lake in northern Venezuela is the largest in South America. The lake and its small basin are situated atop a vast reservoir of buried oil deposits, first tapped in 1914. Venezuela is now the world's fifth largest oil producer. The narrow strait is deepened to allow access by ocean-going vessels, dozens of which now daily transport approximately 80 per cent of Venezuela's oil to world markets. Shipping is one of the main polluters of the lake, caused by the dumping of ballast and other waste. An oil slick, likely related to bilge pumping, can be seen as a bright streak northeast of El Triunfo. Other sources of pollution to the lake include underwater oil pipeline leakage, untreated municipal and industrial waste from coastal cities, and runoff of chemicals from surrounding farm land. Deepening the narrow channel for shipping has also allowed saltwater intrusion into the lake, leading to adverse effects to Lake Biota. Since the discovery of oil, cities like Maracaibo have sprung up along the northwestern coastline of the lake. With satellite cities such as San Luis and El Triunfo, greater Maracaibo has a population of approximately 2.5 million. Just outside the lower margin of the picture a major bridge spans the narrows pictured here, connecting cities such as Altagracia (top right) to Maracaibo.",
